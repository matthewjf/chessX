            <h3>What's ChessX?</h3>
            <p>
              It's realtime chess without turns.
              Any available piece can be moved at any time.
              After a piece moves, it's unavailable for 10 seconds.
              The game ends when either king is captured or 10 minutes elapses.
              Games are meant to be fast and furious.
              If you're not taking pieces, you could be doing it wrong.

            <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
            <h3>Starting</h3>
            <p>
              Once 2 players have joined a game, a countdown will begin.
              The game starts when the countdown ends.
              If either player leaves during the countdown, the game won't start.
              Once a game starts, it will continue until either king is captured or 10 minutes elapses.
              If you leave during a game, no one's going to wait for you.
            </p>
            <h3>Moves</h3>
            <p>
              To make a move, select a one of your own pieces that's not on cooldown.
              The positions available to that piece will be highlighted in green.
              Click on any of the available positions to perform a move.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/moves.png"/>
            <p>
              Pieces can be intercepted during their move.
              If a piece takes another piece in the middle of its move, its move will end.

              Knights: They can't be intercepted.
              They are off the board for a brief period of time during their move.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pawn promotion: Pawns are automatically promoted to queens when they reach the opposite end of the board.
              You don't get to choose. Sorry.
            </p>
            <p>
              En passant: It doesn't exist in ChessX, since you can capture a pawn during its move.
            </p>
            <p>
              Castling: It occurs immediately and cannot be intercepted.
              You can castle if the king and target rook haven't moved yet, and there aren't pieces between.
              Since check doesn't exist, it's not part of the castling requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Draws: If 10 minutes elapses, the game is considered a draw and ends.
